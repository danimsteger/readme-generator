The previously-searched cities are stored in an array local storage. You can view them if you right-click on the page and choose 'Inspect' from the drop-down menu. A new window will open on the right side of the screen and from their you can view the local storage. If on a Firefox browser, the pane will open at the bottom of your screen, instead of on the right side.

## Credits



This project was entirely created by Danielle Steger. To complete this project, I referenced several articles on "MDN Web Docs" and "W3Schools." Additionally, I referenced materials provided by edX Boot Camps LLC. This project was completed with the use of several outside libriaries including jQuery, Bootstrap, and dayjs and their corresponding documentation was referenced as well. Additionally, the OpenWeather API was used to get relevant weather data.
