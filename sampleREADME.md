This project was entirely created by Danielle Steger. To complete this project, I referenced several articles on "MDN Web Docs" and "W3Schools." Additionally, I referenced materials provided by edX Boot Camps LLC. This project was completed with the use of several outside libriaries including jQuery, Bootstrap, and dayjs and their corresponding documentation was referenced as well. Additionally, the OpenWeather API was used to get relevant weather data.
